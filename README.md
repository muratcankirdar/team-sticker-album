# Team Sticker Album

### Summary
This is a POC project of team sticker album. Think you are working remotely on a company with 1200 people and 120 scrum teams.
Almost nobody knows each other. This project's goal is to meet people with their stickers.

Everybody can open 3 sticker sets a day and every sticker set has 6 stickers. When you open a sticker set, you can meet 6 new people in mostly different teams.
